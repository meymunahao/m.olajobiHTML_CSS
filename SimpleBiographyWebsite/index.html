        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Hey there! <br> I am Meymunah Olajobi, a Nigerian Muslim Female who is all about positivity! 
            <br> She is a tech enthusiast and also passionate about teaching. She also is a budding Psychologist. 
            <br> She loves helping people be the best version of themselves, as it gives her fulfillment. 
            <br> She is the 3rd of 5 children in her family, and the only girl.
            <br> One thing that really interests her is marriage. She sometimes is shy to admit it, as she's anxious about what people will think of that.</p>

        <h2>Early Life</h2>
        <p>Meymunah has always been an organized person, and so it's expected of her to be organized at every aspect of her life including academics. 
            <br> However, not until when she was about to get admitted into university (after a gap year) did she now become to get serious about her academics.</p>

    <section id="career">
        <h2>Career</h2>
        <p>She seems to currently be confused about her career. 
            <br><br> This is because, since she was in Junior Secondary School III, 
            she had been volunteerring by teaching at her parents school, and doing excellently well.
            <br> During her gap year as well, alongside the diploma she was taking, she also taught for 6 months, 
            and she did not realize it, but her parents mentioned how passionate she seemed about teaching, and how much she seems to really love it!
            <br> So, Education; teaching (a special type though) is one of her career options.
            <br><br> When she was younger, at some point in her life. She seemed to be really interested in Psychology, and was opportuned with a schorlarship to study Psychology at a university online.
            Though, she could not follow through to the end as she had to resume a physical university to get her BSc. Degree, she really enjoyed the little time spent! 
            <br> So, Psychology -not sure of the area yet though- is another one of her career options.
            <br><br> Currently, at Pan Atlantic Univeristy, she is studying Computer Science, and seems to take a liking to software development.
            <br> So, Software Development -tending towards web and mobile development and human-computer interaction- is what she seems to be interested in.
            <br><br> Thus the crisis! But, I know she'll be fine. With time and conscious self discovery, she'll get there. </p>
